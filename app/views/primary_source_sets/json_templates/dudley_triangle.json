Now known as the Dudley Triangle, the land holds 225 affordable homes, urban farm sites, a community greenhouse, playgrounds, gardens, and more.<br/><br/>Here, you will find maps, comprehensive plans, and reports of the neighborhood, as well as meeting materials, flyers, and neighborhood interviews by the DSNI.",
