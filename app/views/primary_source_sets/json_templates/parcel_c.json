  "title": "Parcel C Protests",
  "intro_text": "In the 1960s, the City of Boston demolished homes and buildings in Chinatown as part of ongoing urban renewal projects. Over the next few decades, community organizations, referendums, and protests blocked construction plans of a 600-car parking garage for Tufts and New England Medical Center. In 2003, Parcel C became home to the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center community center, 251 housing units, and new offices for the Asian Community Development Corporation.<br><br>Here, you will find parcel maps, photographs of protests, and a document collection of Parcel C history, fact sheets, background information, press releases, and reports on environmental concerns.",
