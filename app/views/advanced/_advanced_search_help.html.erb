  <h5>Advanced Search tips:</h5>
  <ul class="advanced_help">
    <li>Use quotation marks to search as a phrase.
    <li>Use "+" before a term to make it required. (Otherwise results matching only some of your terms may be included).</li>
    <li>Use "-" before a word or phrase to exclude it.
    <li>Use "OR", "AND", and "NOT"  within a search field to create complex boolean logic. You can also use parentheses.</li>
    <li>Truncation and wildcards are not supported (word-stemming is done automatically).</li>
  </ul>
