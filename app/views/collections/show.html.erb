              <p>Donated by this owner of a Columbus Avenue saloon, the collection consists of
                photographs of professional baseball in Boston and personal scrapbooks from the 1890's to
                1912. Originally displayed at McGreevey's tavern, Third Base, the photographs form the
                largest collection of its kind. It consists of early Boston baseball photographs dating from
                1875 to 1916 and many of the most important ballplayers of the 19th and early 20th century
                are represented, including Cy Young, Ty Cobb, Mike "King" Kelly, Kid Nichols and many
                others. Also included are panoramic photos of the ballparks of the era including the
                Huntington Avenue Grounds in Boston and the Polo Grounds in New York. The centerpiece of the
                collection is a series of photographs related to the first World Series in 1903 between
                Boston and Pittsburgh. Featured are photographs of the fans of the Boston team, the "Royal
                Rooters" and their leader Michael T. "Nuf Ced" McGreevey. The scrapbooks have been microfilmed and are on call number:
                GV865.M29A3.</p>
